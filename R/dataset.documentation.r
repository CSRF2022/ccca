# dataset documentation

#' Projection parameters
#'
#' A list with all the default projection parameters needed to run a projection. You need to unlist this
#' so that each named element (level 1) in the list is an object in the global environment. You can change
#' these unlisted objects individually. It can be a good idea to unlist the basic parameters file before
#' each projection and then changing only the things you want to make sure you are always starting from
#' the same point each time.
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item q. Survey catchability. Probably 1 or less (scalar)
#'   \item ref.pt. A multiplier of the biomass in the reference period to estimate the reference point (scalar)
#'   \item risk. The acceptable risk of not achieving the reference point in the specified time.frame (scalar 0--1).
#'   \item time.frame. The acceptable time period for achieving the reference point objective (scalar)
#'   \item Bstart.mult. The multiplier of the last data year's biomass which will start the projection (scalar)
#'   \item K. Multiplier of the maximum observed biomass that will be considered the carrying capacity for the density dependent model (scalar)
#'   \item theta. The degree of asymmetry in the density dependent production curve (scalar, 1=symmetric).
#'   \item model.type. This is the kind of model you want to use to fit the PB vs E relationship: gam.adaptive" "poly", "gam.adaptive"
#'   \item poly.degree. The degree of the polynomial to fit for P/B vs E if you chose "poly" for model type
#'   \item knots. The number of knots for a gam.adaptive fit. A good value is n/2.5
#'   \item add.resids. If 1 then multiplicative residuals are sampled from P/B vs E curve. 0 if no residuals (scalar values other than 0 and 1 should NEVER be used)
#'   \item Emean.shift. The change in the mean of the E distribution for a future climate scenario (scalar, + or -)
#'   \item E.var.inc. The change in the variance of the E distribution for a future climate scenario (scalar, 1 for as is, >1 decreases variance)
#'   \item N. The number of Monte Carlo samples for the projection (scalar)
#'   \item proj.years. The number of years to project into the future. Must be >= time.frame (scalar)
#'   \item N.CCF. The number of Monte Carlo samples for each projection for very unique commbination of Emean.shift and F into the future (scalar)
#'   \item Emean.shifts. The Emean.shifts to try for determining CCFs (vector)
#'   \item fs. The exploitation rates to try for determining CCFs (vector)
